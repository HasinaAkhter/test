#This is a repository to test the deployment of a react app into github. 
Here is the step by step guideline:

1. I created a new React app called “test” using the command : create-react-app test
2. I changed to the newly created directory and run the cd website command to start the application. The start command creates a local development server to run the application npm start
3. Created a new repo at github
4. The next step was to convert the local react project to a git repository:
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -a -m 'initial commit'
  
 5. I added the just created repository as the remote repository and pushed the code to it
    git remote add origin
    git push 
    
  6. The next step was to install ‘gh-pages’ package using the following npm command:
        $ npm install --save gh-pages
  7. I modified the package.json file of the project:

     The “homepage” specifies the host path where you want to host the application. 
         The template for the URL is: test repo
         
            “predeploy” specifies the command to build before deployment.
            “deploy” specifies which branch and directory to deploy.
   8. The last step now was to deploy the application using the following command:
          npm run deploy



React documentation:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
